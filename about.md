I grew up in the San Fernando Valley of Southern California. Like many kids who
eventually get into software, I first became interested in computers through
video games and thought I might pursue a career in video game development. I
learned C++ in AP Computer Science and taught myself enough of the Win32 API,
DirectX, and OpenGL to build some very basic demos, but my motivation for
video games didn't last. Instead I found myself thinking about more productive
applications for those skills like symbolic calculators and physics simulators.

Later I discovered open source systems like Linux and FreeBSD, and I spent much
of my free time installing distributions, tweaking configurations, and hosting
internet services from residential DSL. My biggest hobby project was to develop
and host an IRC-like chat system using a text protocol over simple TCP sockets.
For a while, my friends and I actually used this chat as one of our main ways
of communicating with each other.

One of my happiest days was getting accepted to my dream school: the [University
of California at Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), part of so much UNIX and
BSD history. I moved up to the bay area, took as many computer science and math
classes as I could, and graduated with a B.S. in
[EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/).

### Riverbed (2005-2008)
I joined [Riverbed](https://www.riverbed.com/) as an intern after finding their
compression and caching technology to be the most interesting at a career fair.
I built load generators and simulators for performance testing
[Steelhead](https://www.riverbed.com/products/steelhead/) WAN accelerator
appliances. I learned about how TCP works in detail, network diagnostic tools
like `nmap` and `tcpdump`, analyzing bottlenecks in systems (including one my
tool had introduced), and that having too many abstractions in my code made it
harder for others to read. Riverbed had its IPO during my last year there, and
while I didn't understand much at the time, I always remember the excitement
that swept through all my colleagues.

### VMware (2008-2013)
After graduating from school, I joined [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/) as my
first full-time position because I had become interested in virtualization's
possibilities. I worked on VMware View (now
[VMware Horizon](https://www.vmware.com/products/horizon.html)) - first on the
thick client, then on security, followed by server side scalability, and
finally customer intelligence. I learned about a lot of VMware technologies,
the full architecture for large systems with many components, the importance of
making my code easy to review, requirements for enterprise friendliness, and
how to navigate a large organization. This made me realize I had an itch to
start my own company.

### Matterport (2014)
I didn't feel ready to start a company because I didn't know what to do in a
company's earliest days with no product or customers. I joined
[Matterport](https://matterport.com/) because it was an early stage startup,
and I wanted to solve my own frustrations about shopping for real estate. I
worked on the portal where customers access and manage their 3D models. I
learned about some more technologies, especially for enabling _much_ faster
progress than I was used to, the importance of UI/UX design, and the intensely
close bonds I would form with colleagues in such an exciting environment.

### Rubrik (2014-2019)
[Rubrik](https://www.rubrik.com/) started just a few months after I had joined
Matterport, and I was very reluctant to change companies so quickly but 
ultimately I knew that I should get back into a space similar to what I would
like to start a company in. I joined Rubrik as a founding engineer, initially
responsible for data source integration (primarily VMware and Microsoft), then
formed the engineering productivity tools / infrastructure group. I learned
about many technologies especially related to distributed systems, the
importance of product/market fit, fund raising and startup equity, recruiting
strategies, sales processes, and leadership covering the whole organization.

### Entrepreneur (2020-)
After learning what I needed, I now feel as ready as I can reasonably expect to
feel for starting a company. I left Rubrik in late 2019 and spent time
unwinding to prepare for my next step. First I traveled (literally) around the
world, visiting Peru, Brazil, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. Then I
spent quality time with family during the holidays. Now I'm finally working as
an entrepreneur.
