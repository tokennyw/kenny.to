Hello, I am an entrepreneur in the SF bay area. My professional experience
includes software engineering and leadership at companies developing products
for enterprise IT: [Rubrik](https://www.rubrik.com/),
[VMware](https://www.vmware.com/), and [Riverbed](https://www.riverbed.com/).
The next step in my journey is to be a founder of my own company.

## Status: Researching
Since the start of 2020, I have been researching for startup ideas. There are
many possibilities, and my criteria for finally choosing are:
- **Ecosystem Potential** - After achieving success with one product, I'm keen
  on having possibilities to follow up with related or adjacent products in the
  company's "act two", "act three", and so on to ultimately build a large suite
  of successful products.
- **Enterprise Facing** - All my experience has been with enterprises. I'm also
  most comfortable with straightforward, boring business models where
  businesses pay for products they directly get value from.
- **Infrastructure Related** - I tend to be most interested in technology that
  has broad application to help businesses in all sectors. My intrinsic
  motivation is to maximize impact.

I do this research mainly by meeting people: potential clients, cofounders, and
investors. If you have thoughts about difficult problems in enterprise
technology, I'd love to hear from you! Send me an [email](mailto:me@kenny.to),
or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tokennyw/). I can
usually meet anywhere between San Francisco and San Jose.
